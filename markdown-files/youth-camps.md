### Stake Guidelines for Youth Conferences and Camps
(Revised January 2026)

Youth conferences and camps are important activities for young men and young women, providing opportunities for spiritual growth, social interaction, and leadership development. When planning youth conferences or camps, including travel and overnight activities, several guidelines should be followed to ensure a safe and spiritually enriching experience:

1. **Purpose of Activities:** The purposes of youth conferences and camps include building faith in Jesus Christ, strengthening testimonies, developing talents, making new friends, and having fun with youth who share similar beliefs and standards. Activities should be consistent with a gospel theme and approved by the bishopric or stake presidency. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number16" target="_blank">20.4 Youth Conference</a>.

2. **Planning and Approval:** Youth conferences and camps are planned and carried out by the ward youth council under the direction of the bishopric, or by the stake youth leadership committee for stake-level conferences. The bishopric or stake presidency must approve all plans, themes, speakers, and activities. By planning effectively and following safety precautions, leaders can minimize the risk of accidents. Youth may not participate in a Church activity without the permission of their parents or guardians, which includes written consent using the <a href="https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/ec/6a/ec6a32b2ded011eda8abeeeeac1eefc32321140e/parental_or_guardian_permission_medical_release.pdf" target="_blank">Permission and Medical Release Form</a> if the activity includes an overnight stay, lengthy travel, or higher than ordinary risks. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number16" target="_blank">20.4 Youth Conference</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number50" target="_blank">20.7.4 Parental Permission</a>, and <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number52" target="_blank">20.7.6 Safety Precautions, Accident Response, and Accident Reporting</a> and online resources such as the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/english/safety/pdf/PD60010959_000_interactive.pdf?lang=eng" target="_blank">Recreational Property Health and Safety Checklist form</a> and other Preparing for Activities resources at <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/safety/preparing-for-activities?lang=eng" target="_blank">churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/safety/preparing-for-activities</a>.

3. **Age Requirements:** Youth may attend overnight camps beginning in January of the year they turn 12. They may attend dances, youth conferences, and For the Strength of Youth (FSY) conferences beginning in January of the year they turn 14. Eighteen-year-olds may also attend, including those who have been ordained elders and those who have been endowed. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number43" target="_blank">20.7.2 Age Requirements for Participation in Youth Activities</a> and <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number16" target="_blank">20.4 Youth Conference</a>.

4. **Supervision:** Adequate adult supervision is required at all times during youth conferences and camps. At least two adults, more depending on the size of the group must be present at all Church activities attended by youth. Adult leaders, including parents, are invited to attend as much of the youth conferences or camps as possible. All who work with youth must complete the children and youth protection training available at <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/safety/protecting-children-and-youth?lang=eng" target="_blank">ProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a>. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number16" target="_blank">20.4 Youth Conference</a> and <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number42" target="_blank">20.7.1 Adult Supervision</a>.

5. **Safety:** Leaders and participants carefully assess activities to ensure minimal risk of injury, illness, or damage to property. Leaders should follow all safety guidelines to ensure the well-being of participants. Leaders should be prepared for emergencies and know in advance how to contract local law enforcement and emergency services. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number52" target="_blank">20.7.6 Safety Precautions, Accident Response, and Accident Reporting</a> and <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/safety?lang=eng" target="_blank">Safety and Health for Church Activities FAQs</a>.

6. **Insurance:** Members and leaders should carry reasonable amounts of liability insurance to protect themselves. This insurance can include homeowners, personal health and accident, and vehicle insurance. If an injury occurs during a Church activity, members who have insurance should utilize all available benefits before seeking assistance through the Church Activity Medical Assistance program. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number44" target="_blank">20.7.3 Insurance</a>.

7. **Travel:** Travel for Church activities should be approved by the bishop or stake president and should not place undue burdens on members. Participants should not travel long distances (more than a few hours) for activities. When feasible, use commercial transportation (licensed and protected by liability insurance) for long-distance travel. When using private passenger vehicles, each vehicle must be in safe operating condition and have reasonable amounts of automobile liability insurance. Each person should use a seat belt. Drivers should be licensed, responsible adults.
The Grantsville Utah Stake, as consistent with the travel practices and the application of guidelines for all units in the Tooele coordinating council, has determined the travel distance should be within 3 to 3 ½ hours from Grantsville. Distances greater than 3 to 3 ½ hours from Grantsville **must** go through the stake president for review and approval of an exception by the Area Presidency. Approval by the Area Presidency must be received **_before_** making reservations and non-refundable deposits for any activity located more than 3 to 3 ½ hours from Grantsville. **Church units that make non-refundable deposits for long distance activities prior to receiving Area Presidency risk losing these budget funds if the Area Presidency denies the exception to this travel distance rule**.
See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number57" target="_blank">20.7.7 Travel</a>, <a href="https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/4g/2c/4g2cqqrzuu6ktrwtl7zd1xo4uimj2xyoetqgrha5/event_and_activity_plan_form_update.pdf" target="_blank">Event and Activity Plan form</a>, and <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/safety?lang=eng" target="_blank">Safety and Health for Church Activities FAQs</a>.

8. **Overnight Activities:** Church overnight activities for combined groups of young men and young women must be approved by the bishop and stake president. Male and female participants and leaders should have separate sleeping accommodations; however, a married couple may share the same room or tent. Church overnight activities must include at least two adult leaders. Leaders fill out an <a href="https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/4g/2c/4g2cqqrzuu6ktrwtl7zd1xo4uimj2xyoetqgrha5/event_and_activity_plan_form_update.pdf" target="_blank">Event and Activity Plan form</a> for all overnight activities. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number34" target="_blank">20.5.5 Overnight Activities</a>.

9. **Funding:** Youth conferences are funded from the stake or ward budget, and members should not be asked to pay for these events, including materials, supplies, rental or admission fees, or long-distance transportation. If the ward or stake budget does not have enough funds for one annual extended Aaronic Priesthood camp or Young Women camp or similar activity, leaders may ask participants to pay for all or part of them. Lack of personal funds should not keep a member from participating. See General Handbook <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/20-activities?lang=eng#title_number18" target="_blank">20.6 Policies and Guidelines for Funding Activities</a>.
